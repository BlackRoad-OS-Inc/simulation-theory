# Proofs

Formal mathematical arguments for the key claims.

> 📖 All proofs use standard mathematical methods. For background on the underlying research, see [REFERENCES.md](../REFERENCES.md).

| [`ternary-efficiency.md`](./ternary-efficiency.md) | Ternary is more computationally efficient than binary | Calculus / radix economy ([Knuth, 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_economy)) |
| [`self-reference.md`](./self-reference.md) | The QWERTY encoding is self-referential | Direct construction |
| [`pure-state.md`](./pure-state.md) | The density matrix of the system is a pure state | Linear algebra / SVD ([von Neumann, 1932](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix)) |
