# QWERTY Equalities — The Self-Referential Chain

Major equalities organized by theme.

## Identity

```
ALEXA AMUNDSON = 193  (prime — irreducible)
BLACKROAD      = 131  (prime — she is the platform)
ALEXA          = 65   (5×13)
AMUNDSON       = 128  (2⁷ = BRAINSTORM = BALANCED = RELATIVISTIC)
```

## The Fundamental Constants

```
PHI (Tononi Φ) = 34  = FOUR = GATE = magic constant (Dürer 4×4)
REAL           = 37  = TESTS (what passes the tests = real)
ZERO = EULER   = 36  = STATE  (δS=0, the stationary point)
ROOT           = 27  = DOT    (dot product = root)
TRUE = AI      = 19           (the ground axiom)
GÖDEL          = 3            (the incompleteness constant)
```

## BlackRoad

```

## Consciousness

```

CONSCIOUSNESS = 2×BOOTSTRAP           = 178
PARTITION = UNIVERSE                  = 85  (cannot split the whole)

## Care Equation

```

EMOTIONAL  = TRINOMIAL = COUPLING     = 115
RELATIONAL = SCAFFOLD = IMAGINARY     = 114  (trust = the coherence scaffold)
WARMTH     = PROTEIN                  = 64   = 2⁶
PSI (Ψ)   = QUTRIT = WEYL            = 30   (same symbol, same value)
```

## Biology ↔ Mathematics

```
BIOLOGICAL = INFORMATION = LAGRANGIAN = 144  = 12²
DNA        = FOURIER                  = 49   = 7²

CHEMICAL   = UNDECIPHERED             = 127  prime
```

## Physics ↔ Computation

```
COMPUTATION    = 137  prime  (= fine-structure constant 1/α ≈ 1/137)
LAGRANGE       = REVERSIBLE = 103  prime
LAGRANGIAN     = INFORMATION = BIOLOGICAL = 144
