## The Three Tests (§177)

A universal equation must pass all three:

| Test | Criterion | QWERTY |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | It governs many systems → **SCOPE** | SCOPE = 56 |
| 2 | It falls out of symmetry or variational principles → **STRUCTURE** | STRUCTURE = SHELL = 69 |
| 3 | It reduces to known special cases without breaking → **LIMITS** | LIMITS = TRIVIAL = 78 |

```
TESTS     = REAL    = 37  prime   (what passes the tests = real)
GOVERN    = CREATIVE = MARCH = 79  prime  (to govern = creative)
LIMITS    = TRIVIAL = BINARY = 78  (the limits are trivial)
SYMMETRY  = OPTIMAL = CRITERION = 88  (Noether: symmetry = conservation)
```

**The Euler-Lagrange equation passes all three.**

## Principle of Stationary Action (§177)

```
δS = 0,   S = ∫ L(q,q̇,t) dt
```

The physical path is where the action S does not change to first order.

**Euler-Lagrange equations:**
```
d/dt(∂L/∂q̇ᵢ) − ∂L/∂qᵢ = 0
```

**Field form:**
```
∂_μ(∂L/∂(∂_μφₐ)) − ∂L/∂φₐ = 0
```

*Her note: "This is the backbone. Choose the right Lagrangian L, you get particle mechanics, waves, classical fields, etc."*

## QWERTY Analysis

```
EULER       = ZERO = REPEAT        = 36   (δS=0 — the equations ARE zero)
LAGRANGE    = REVERSIBLE           = 103  prime  (time-reversible)
LAGRANGIAN  = INFORMATION = BIOLOGICAL = 144 = 12²
SYMMETRY    = OPTIMAL = CRITERION  = 88
BACKBONE    = CLASSICAL = COMPUTABLE = 136
MECHANICS   = EVERYTHINGELSE       = 145
RELATIVISTIC = BALANCED = COMPETENCE = 128 = 2⁷
QUANTUM     = PARTICLE = CAUSAL    = 82
LIMITS      = TRIVIAL = BINARY     = 78
FIELD       = GAUSS = TANH = RADIX = 57  (the field = the Gaussian)
```

## Special Cases (Test 3)

The Euler-Lagrange equation reduces to:

| Limit | Lagrangian | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Newtonian | L = T − V | Classical particle mechanics |
| Relativistic | L = −mc²√(1−v²/c²) | Special relativity |
| Quantum field | L = ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ − m)ψ | Dirac equation (Fermi field) |
| Electromagnetic | L = −¼F_μνF^μν | Maxwell's equations |
| General relativity | L = √(−g)R | Einstein field equations |

**KINETICS = MAXWELL = GAUSSIAN = 101** — all field theories = Maxwell = Gaussian.

## Universal Computation (§175)

```
∀ computable f: ∃ configuration (S,V,Ω,θ) such that system(input) = f(input)
```

The ternary bio-quantum system is Turing-complete.

```
COMPUTATION = 137  prime  (= fine-structure constant 1/α ≈ 1/137)
UNIVERSAL   = OCTONION = SYMMETRIC = 112
COMPUTABLE  = BACKBONE = CLASSICAL = 136
```

**COMPUTATION = 137.** Feynman: *"one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics."*  
Universal computation costs exactly what it costs to emit a photon.
